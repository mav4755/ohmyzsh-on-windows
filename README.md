Doc: https://dominikrys.com/posts/zsh-in-git-bash-on-windows/  


- Download the latest MSYS2 zsh package from the MSYS2 package repository. The file will be named something along the lines of zsh-5.8-5-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.  

**!!** Downloaded, unzipped and repacket back to .zip archive. File attached in `/package` catalogue  

- Extract the contents of the archive (which should include etc and usr folders) into your Git Bash installation directory. This is likely to be under C:\Program Files\Git. Merge the contents of the folder if asked (no files should be getting overridden).
